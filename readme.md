# üåç FinCrime Signals

**FinCrime Signals** is a synthetic data and workflow simulator inspired by Wise‚Äôs real-world financial-crime controls.  
It models **cross-border money movement**, **KYC/EDD pipelines**, and **jurisdictional risk logic** across 160 supported countries and territories.

## üß† Overview

This project builds a realistic AML/KYC simulation environment using Python and synthetic data to reproduce Wise-like compliance behaviors:

- Customer onboarding and KYC risk scoring  
- Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) for high-risk profiles  
- Transaction monitoring and sanctions screening  
- Country and currency-based regulatory logic  
- Data pipelines that generate realistic customer & transaction CSVs
