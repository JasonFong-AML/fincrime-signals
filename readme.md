# üåç FinCrime Signals

**FinCrime Signals** is a synthetic data and workflow simulator inspired by real-world financial-crime controls. It models **cross-border money movement**, **KYC/EDD pipelines**, and **jurisdictional risk logic** across 160 supported countries and territories.

## üß† Overview

This project builds a realistic AML/KYC simulation environment using Python and synthetic data to reproduce Wise-like compliance behaviors:

The focus of this project will be on the AML investigator workflow hence the customer onboarding and kyc risk scoring will be assumed as fields in 


- Customer onboarding and KYC risk scoring  
- Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) for high-risk profile
- Transaction monitoring and sanctions screening  
- Country and currency-based regulatory logic  
- Data pipelines that generate realistic customer & transaction CSVs

### Compliance Workflow (simplified)

Each block in the flowchart represents a critical defense layer within a financial crime prevention system. Together, they form a continuous loop of risk identification ‚Üí mitigation ‚Üí reporting ‚Üí learning.

| Stage | Description | Key Investigator Understanding |
|:--|:--|:--|
| üß† KYC (Know Your Customer) | Establishes the customer‚Äôs identity, source of funds, and intended account use. | A robust KYC profile defines the ‚Äúexpected behavior baseline.‚Äù Investigators rely on this to identify when a customer‚Äôs actual transactions deviate from expectations. |
| üîç EDD (Enhanced Due Diligence) | Conducted for higher-risk customers (based on nationality, industry, or transaction patterns). | Involves verifying documentation, analyzing ownership structure, and checking for adverse media. This prevents onboarding entities that could expose the institution to sanctions or reputational risk. |
| üîÑ ODD (Ongoing Due Diligence) | Ensures that customer activity remains consistent with their profile. | Investigators use transaction monitoring tools to detect anomalies (e.g., sudden large inflows, layering activity). Triggers are reviewed, and KYC profiles are refreshed if risk exposure increases. |
| <span style="background-color:#ffe5e5;">üí£ AML Monitoring (Anti-Money Laundering)</span> | <span style="background-color:#ffe5e5;">Systemic detection of suspicious financial activity such as layering, structuring, or terrorist financing.</span> | <span style="background-color:#ffe5e5;">Alerts are generated based on pre-defined typologies and behavioral rules (e.g., velocity checks, cross-border transfers, or cash-intensive flows). Investigators assess whether patterns are suspicious or explainable.</span> |
| üß© Investigation | Deep-dive case review where analysts gather supporting documentation and evaluate intent. | Analysts apply both quantitative (transaction data) and qualitative (customer communication, behavior) analysis to form a judgment. |
| üßæ SAR/STR Reporting | Filing of Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) or Suspicious Transaction Reports (STRs) to FIUs. | Accuracy and clarity in narrative writing are critical. Reports must state facts, reasoning, and conclusions without bias. |
| üîÅ Feedback Loop | Learning mechanism to improve system performance and reduce false positives. | Investigator insights feed back into rule tuning, product risk design, and training datasets for model-based monitoring. |
